# 🟢 Bino – Your WhatsApp Search Buddy

Bino is a smart chatbot web app that simulates WhatsApp-style search. It replies instantly to user queries using predefined keywords as well as real-time information from external APIs like Wikipedia, JokeAPI, and GNews. Just ask a question, and Bino responds with informative, funny, or trending answers in a friendly chat interface.
